# Correlation between fertilizer consumption and wheat production - R lang

## Here, I aimed to plot and analyze public agricultural data — such as Fertilizer Consumption (from [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.CON.FERT.ZS)) and Wheat Production (from [FAO](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL)) — to get a better understanding of both agriculture and R programming.

First of all, it’s better to get familiar with the file structure in this project:

-   **OfficialDataFiles** -\> Original CSV files downloaded directly from official sources; they may look messy or unorganized.

-   **FilteredDataFiles** -\> Cleaned and organized versions of the OfficialDataFiles, specifically prepared for use in this project.

-   **Fertilizer-CropYield.R** -\> Main code file
